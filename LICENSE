This reference card was created during my time taking CS271 (Computer
Architecture and Assembly Language) at Oregon State University taught by
Stephen Redfield. Some of the information here was respectfully taken from the
very well organised Canvas page. Thanks OSU and Sir Redfield!

                                   DISCLAIMER

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED
HEREIN MAY OR MAY NOT BE CORRECT. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU BRICK YOUR
MACHINE OR FAIL ANY EXAMS USING ANY INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS REFERENCE CARD.

                              Returning the favor

If you find this software useful AND you find an error, you are morally but not
legally obliged to fix the error and create a pull request. I will probably
never write a program in MASM again, but there are other poor souls who will.
I will merge the pull request for sake of humanity.
